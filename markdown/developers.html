# Welcome
Welcome to DDF project! If you're reading this document then you are probably interested in contributing to DDF. DDF is under active development and needs contributions not only in the form of code but also in documentation, feedback, ideas, bug reports etc. We would like you to consider yourself part of this endeavor.

# Contribute
This section explains the different ways in which to contribute to DDF

<a name="report-bug"></a>

## Report a bug
To report a bug you need to create an issue on <a href="https://github.com/ddf-project/DDF/issues" target="_blank">github</a>. To help us solve issues efficiently, you can provide us with following information:

1. Include error messages and log, we recommend to use [gist](http://gist.github.com) to paste log.
2. Short description how to reproduce the bug.


<a name="contributing-code"></a>
## Contributing code

<a name="create-a-pull-request"></a>
### Create a Pull Request
You should create a pull request on the DDF project repository. Please follow the instructions on <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request" target="_blank">github</a>. In addition to that, we request that you provide a description on the Pull Request about the problem statement or goals for the request  and the provided solution. If you want to test the waters before embarking in a development effort, please enter a issue in the issue tracker (see [Report a bug](#report-bug) above, it's the same process). Submitting a pull request is no guarantee of acceptance, so if it's a lot of work it's nice to know that it goes in a direction the committers support.

### Approval process
All Pull Requests will be reviewed by a committer. He or she will review, test it and respond in a timely manner. In general all pull requests need to satisfy the following criteria:

 1. Pass all unit tests.
 2. Conform to formatting standard (we will strive to provide an automated solution for this)

<a name="request-feature"></a>
## Request a new feature

We welcome all ideas and comments. Before you request feature, please take a look at our current <a href="../plans.html" target="_blank">roadmap</a>.

To request a new feature you should open an issue in our <a href="https://github.com/ddf-project/DDF/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a> and summarize the desired functionality.
You can also send a message to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ddf-project" target="_blank"> DDF google group</a>.

## Tools

<a name="best-practices-testing"></a>
### Testing
We use maven to run unit test. You can also use sbt test.


<a name="best-practices-development"></a>
